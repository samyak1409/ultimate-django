## Creating Your First Django Project

### Virtual Environment:

Install pipenv:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Now, move to the directory where you want the virtual environment to be, then run:

```bash
pipenv install django
```

This creates a virtual environment at a location like:

```
/Users/samyak/.local/share/virtualenvs/Ultimate_Django-xxxxxxxx
```

All the libraries are installed here.

A `Pipfile` is also created, which looks like a `requirements.txt` file, but `pipenv` automatically adds the packages you install (using `pipenv`) to this file.

<br>

To get the path of the current virtual environment:

```bash
pipenv --venv
```

To activate the virtual environment:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

<br>

**Important:** Make sure whenever you do anything in the terminal inside this directory, the virtual environment is activated.
The terminal would look like:

```
(Ultimate Django) samyak@Mac Ultimate Django %
```

or

```
Ultimate Djangosamyak@Mac Ultimate Django %
```

That is, the directory name appears as a prefix before `samyak@Mac`.

## Using the Integrated Terminal in VSCode

Important: VS Code activates the venv in the terminal automatically when the Python interpreter of current project is set to the venv one. Else, it does not.

## Creating Your First App

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Django_(web_framework):

> It follows the model–template–views (MTV) architectural pattern.
> Despite having its own nomenclature (such as naming the callable objects generating the HTTP responses "views"), the core Django framework can be seen as an MVC architecture.  
> It consists of:  
> -- an object-relational mapper (ORM) that mediates between data models (defined as Python classes) and a relational database ("Model"),  
> -- a system for processing HTTP requests with a web templating system ("View"),  
> -- and a regular-expression-based URL dispatcher ("Controller").

<br>

We can specify the port number explicitly if some other app is running on the default port 8000:

```bash
python manage.py runserver 9000
```

<br>

See `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`.

- `apps.py` – Should've been named `app_config.py` instead, since it contains the app's configuration.
- `views.py` – Again, the name is misleading. It's actually a request handler. "Views" usually refer to templates or HTML in web development.
  "Views" in other frameworks = "Templates" in Django.

## Writing Views

Views or view functions take a request and return a response.

## Mapping URLs to Views

## Using Templates

We can replace Django's default template engine with a preferred template engine if we want.

> Important: We don't use templates in Django that often now. Django is primarily used to build APIs.

## Debugging Django Applications in VSCode

Similar to normal Python debugger.

## Using Django Debug Toolbar

https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

Install with:

```bash
pipenv install django-debug-toolbar
```
