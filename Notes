Virtual Env:

`pip3 install pipenv`

Now, move to the dir where you want the virtual env to be, there:
`pipenv install django`

(A virtual env is created at a location like "/Users/samyak/.local/share/virtualenvs/Ultimate_Django-Wh554gmP", where all the libs are installed.)

Also, `Pipfile` is also created which looks like `requirements.txt`, but `pipenv` automatically adds the packages we install (using `pipenv`) to this file.

Get the path of current venv:
`pipenv --venv`

Activate the venv:
`pipenv shell`

IMPORTANT: Make sure whenever you do anything in the terminal inside this dir, venv is activated, the termnial would look like:
`(Ultimate Django) samyak@Mac Ultimate Django %`
i.e. dir name prefix in bracket before `samyak@Mac`



Django:

We can specify the port number explicitly if some other app is running on the default port 8000:
`python manage.py runserver 9000`
