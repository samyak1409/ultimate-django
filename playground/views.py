    # (Using `list`s since `QuerySet`s are lazy.)
    # NOTE: Below examples doesn't contain all possible queries but just a basic intro. Refer to API Reference https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref for that.

    # Retrieving Objects:
    if 0:

        list(Product.objects.all())
        # returns queryset of all the objects
        # Note: `QuerySet` objects contains the actual objects/instances of the queried model class.
        # Access to the data is done using `object.attr` syntax. E.g. `product.title` (`product` is `Product`'s instance var / object)

        Product.objects.get(pk=1)
        # returns single object

        # Product.objects.get(pk=0)
        # if object does not exist, raise `DoesNotExist` exception

        # So one solution is:
        try:
            Product.objects.get(pk=0)
        except ObjectDoesNotExist:
            pass

        # But better:
        Product.objects.filter(pk=0).first()
        # `.first()` returns the first object from the qs, if the qs is empty, it returns `None`

        # We can also pre-check:
        Product.objects.filter(pk=0).exists()
        # returns bool

    # Filtering Objects:
    if 0:

        list(Product.objects.filter(unit_price=10))

        # What if we want other operators like `>`?
        list(Product.objects.filter(unit_price__gt=20))

        # SQL's `BETWEEN` keyword:
        list(Product.objects.filter(unit_price__range=(20, 25)))  # inclusive

        # We can also use the relationship field, and use the related table's field name:
        list(Product.objects.filter(collection__title="Pets"))
        # Lookup types can be applied on top of this as well.

        # `LIKE`:
        list(Product.objects.filter(title__contains="coffee"))
        # case-insensitive:
        list(Product.objects.filter(title__icontains="coffee"))
        # We also have `startswith`, `endswith`, etc.

        # Dates:
        list(Product.objects.filter(last_update__year=2021))
        # i.e. we can extract individual components of a date / datetime field

        # NULL:
        list(Product.objects.filter(description__isnull=True))

        # Exercises (from ORM_Filtering.pdf):

        # 1) Customers with .com accounts:
        list(Customer.objects.filter(email__endswith=".com"))

        # 2) Collections that donâ€™t have a featured product:
        list(Collection.objects.filter(featured_product__isnull=True))

        # 3) Products with low inventory (less than 10):
        list(Product.objects.filter(inventory__lt=10))

        # 4) Orders placed by customer with id = 1:
        list(Order.objects.filter(customer=1))

        # 5) Order items for products in collection 3:

        # `__`: nested lookup

    # Complex Lookups Using Q Objects:

        # Multiple filters (`AND` in SQL):
        list(Product.objects.filter(inventory__lt=10).filter(unit_price__lt=20))
        # But better:
        list(Product.objects.filter(inventory__lt=10, unit_price__lt=20))

        # But how would we do `OR`, there comes `Q` (short for query) objects:
        list(Product.objects.filter(Q(inventory__lt=10) | Q(unit_price__lt=20)))
        # Every `Q` object take a single kwarg.
        # `|` = Bitwise OR -> SQL `OR`
        # `&` = Bitwise AND -> SQL `AND`
        # `~` = Bitwise NOT -> SQL `NOT`
        list(Product.objects.filter(Q(inventory__lt=10) | ~Q(unit_price__lt=20)))

    # Referencing Fields using F Objects:
    if 0:

        # `F` (for field) objects are used when we want records where field1 == field2:
        # list(Product.objects.filter(inventory=unit_price))  # can't do this, right, so ->
        list(Product.objects.filter(inventory=F("unit_price")))
        # And, we can also use `__` to navigate to a related field's table like we did in "Filtering Objects" section above:
        list(Product.objects.filter(description=F("collection__title")))
        # In `collection__title`, `collection` is the foreign key, `title` is a field in the Collection table.

        # This was pretty straight-forward.

    # Sorting:

        list(Product.objects.order_by("title"))
        # Desc:
        list(Product.objects.order_by("-title"))
        list(Product.objects.order_by("title").reverse())

        # Sorting on two fields, one after other (just like we do in python):
        list(Product.objects.order_by("unit_price", "title"))
        list(Product.objects.order_by("-unit_price", "title"))

        # And obviously `order_by` works on `QuerySet`s.

        # Getting the first/last / min/max / top:
        Product.objects.order_by("-unit_price")[0]
        # We've convenience methods for this:
        Product.objects.earliest("unit_price")  # basically, ASC
        Product.objects.latest("unit_price")  # basically, DESC

    # Limiting Results:
    if 0:

        list(Product.objects.all()[:5])

        # `LIMIT 15 OFFSET 10` (skip 10, then give (next) 15):
        list(Product.objects.all()[10:25])

    # Selecting Fields to Query:

        # Selecting selected columns instead of *:
        list(Product.objects.values("id", "title", "collection__title"))
        # Note that we can also use the related field using `__`, this is done using (INNER) JOIN by Django.
        # Also, as we know that `QuerySet` objects contains the actual objects/instances of the queried model class.
        # But, above return a `ValuesQuerySet` which is basically a `QuerySet` of `dict` objects not model class objects.
        # Key-value pairs are field-value.
        # e.g. vqs[0] = {'id': 2, 'title': 'Island Oasis - Raspberry', 'collection_title': 'Beauty'}

        list(Product.objects.values_list("id", "title", "collection__title"))
        # Same as above, this just contains `tuple` instead of `dict`.

                print(product.description)  # bug: 1 query n times
        # What's the bug?
        # When we use `only()`, the returned queryset contains the objects with only the fields passed as arg.
        # If by mistake we access any other field, then the Django won't throw an error, but instead go ahead and query the DB to get the result.
        # So, if that bug is inside a for loop and run for every record in our table like above, it would hang the app for some seconds.
        # Hence, take precaution using this.

        # Opposite of `only` in working, selects all the fields other than specified one(s):
        list(Product.objects.defer("description"))
        # Also, same precaution to be taken here as well.

    # Selecting Related Objects:

        # [First of all, didn't know we can do `product.collection.title`,
        # Django automatically generates this query with the help of INNER JOIN, just like it does in the case of dunder `collection__title`.]
        # What's the bug?
        # Exactly same problem as above, it is being done n times.
        # But, what if we actually want to access the values of related field's table's other fields.
        # There comes `select_related()` (for `OneToOneField` & `ForeignKey`):
        for product in Product.objects.select_related("collection"):  # 1 query
            print(product.title, end=" --- ")  # correct
            print(product.collection.title)  # correct
        # Here, Django uses a INNER JOIN at the very start only, and selects all the fields of both tables, hence all the fields can be accessed. (Only 1 query in total.)
        # Important notes:
        # - We can use `Product.objects.select_related('collection__title')` i.e. nested lookup as well.
        #   - To select `title`, `collection` needs to be selected, so we never need to do `Product.objects.select_related('collection', 'collection__title')`,
        #     and it's considered redundant.
        # - Multiple fields can also be supplied: `OrderItem.objects.select_related('order', 'product')`

        # `prefetch_related()` (for `ManyToManyField` & reverse `ForeignKey` (i.e., when accessing the `_set` on a model)):
        list(Product.objects.prefetch_related("promotions"))
        # IMP: Read the markdown notes for this.

        # What if we want to access data from `OneToOneField` / `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` / reverse `ForeignKey` together?
        # We can call `select_related` & `prefetch_related` one after another (in any order since both of them return a QS):
        list(
            Product.objects.select_related("collection").prefetch_related("promotions")

        # Also, multiple aggregates can be passed:

        # {'id__count': 1000, 'unit_price__min': Decimal('1.06')}
        # Returns the dict containing:
        # - key = param name if used else arg inside the aggregate object
        # - value = result
        # So, we can also do if we want:
        print(Product.objects.aggregate(count=Count("id"), min_price=Min("unit_price")))
        # {'count': 1000, 'min_price': Decimal('1.06')}
